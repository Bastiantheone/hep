[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/go-hep/fwk/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/go-hep/fwk/latest)

`fwk` is a HEP oriented concurrent framework written in `Go`.
`fwk` should be easy to pick up and use for small and fast analyses but should also support reconstruction, simulation, ... use cases.

## Installation

`fwk`, like any pure-Go package, is `go get` able:

```sh
$ go get github.com/go-hep/fwk/...
```

(yes, with the ellipsis after the slash, to install all the "sub-packages")


## Documentation

The documentation is available on `godoc`:
